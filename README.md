# Bingo Lotto Simulator

A simple and naive simulation where Tickets are generated on the same format as during "uppesittar kv√§ll". That is each
ticket has 5 different rounds where each round has the same probability of winning. Then between 20-25 numbers are
drafted. Get 5 in a row and you get Bingo. The program calculates the average win percentage by simulating N drafts for
the M generated tickets.
